1. In NewTradeData view I need to adjust the html and java script:
	- HTML: add the new partial view _ResearchCradleData
	- JS: make a if statement to which selects the research data for the selected strategy
	- This then needs to be passed to the controller.
	- The passed object needs to be savable in the ResearchCradle. Check if BaseTrade table and the new ResearchCradle 
	save the data correctly.
